# RTL8192eu linux drivers for Raspberry Pi

The official drivers for D-Link DWA-131 Rev E, with patches to keep it working on newer kernels on Raspberry Pi.  
Also works on Rosewill RNX-N180UBE v2 N300 Wireless Adapter.

**NOTE:** This repo was forked from [Mange/rtl8192eu-linux-driver](https://github.com/Mange/rtl8192eu-linux-driver).  
Kudos to ``Magnus Bergmark <magnus.bergmark@gmail.com>`` for the great work. 

You have two ways to install this driver:

 1. [Building and installing using the source code](https://github.com/lord2y/rtl8192eu-arm-linux-driver#building-and-installing-using-source-code)
 2. [Building and installing using dkms](https://github.com/lord2y/rtl8192eu-arm-linux-driver#building-and-installing-using-dkms)

## Building and installing using the source code

1. Install DKMS and other required tools

    ```shell
    # apt-get install git raspberrypi-kernel-headers build-essential bc dkms
    ```

2. Compile driver

    ```shell
    # make ARCH=arm
    ```

3. Install the driver

    ```shell
    # make install
    ```
    
If you wish to uninstall the driver at a later point, use

    # make uninstall  

## Building and installing using DKMS

This tree supports Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS), a system for
generating kernel modules from out-of-tree kernel sources. It can be used to
install/uninstall kernel modules, and the module will be automatically rebuilt
from source when the kernel is upgraded (for example using your package manager).

1. Install DKMS and other required tools

    ```shell
    # apt-get install git raspberrypi-kernel-headers build-essential bc dkms
    ```

2. Add the driver to DKMS. This will copy the source to a system directory so
that it can used to rebuild the module on kernel upgrades.

    ```shell
    # dkms add .
    ```

3. Build and install the driver.

    ```shell
    # dkms install rtl8192eu/1.0
    ```  

If you wish to uninstall the driver at a later point, use

    # dkms uninstall rtl8192eu/1.0  

To completely remove the driver from DKMS use

    # dkms remove rtl8192eu/1.0 --all  

## Submitting patches
